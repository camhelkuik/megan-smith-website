     <p> The therapeutic approach Megan uses is psychodynamic therapy, which focuses on coming to terms with what is within us, rather than looking for ways to get rid of a particular symptom. Working psychodynamically means paying particular attention to the exchange taking place between therapist and client rather than the discussion of ideas, giving advice or assigning labels. This allows for an environment where defensive patterns are not just referred to but may be seen functioning for what they are, specifically to block our potential to face reality, feel discomfort, obstruct intimacy and avoid vulnerability. Using this approach, a person may gain new insight into how their choices were being determined and can then experience a freedom to make different ones. Having the freedom to choose allows for a more intentional and unrestricted life.</p>
      <p>Megan calls upon her training in feminist psychoanalytic theory, Jungian psychology, relational psychoanalysis and queer theory to help guide the work. Many people can only attend therapy once a week, while others want more frequent help.</p>
